                  Welcome to our educational journey where we unlock the secrets of DNA and how traits are passed down through generations. Our genetic makeup is like a blueprint for building and maintaining our body. It's composed of DNA, a molecule that contains our genes. Genes are segments of DNA that carry instructions for our development, functioning, growth, and reproduction. These genes are packed into structures called chromosomes, of which humans have 23 pairs, totaling 46.
                    <br/><br/>
                    In autosomal dominant inheritance, only one copy of a mutated gene from one parent is needed to inherit a condition or trait. This means if a parent has the trait, there's a 50% chance it will be passed to each child, regardless of the child's sex. Autosomal recessive inheritance requires two copies of a mutated gene for the individual to exhibit the trait or condition— one from each parent. Parents who each carry one copy of the mutated gene are referred to as carriers. They typically do not show symptoms of the condition. However, there's a 25% chance their child will inherit both copies of the mutated gene and express the condition.
                    <br/><br/>
                    How can detect mutations: In simple terms, sequencing is one of the cutting-edge techniques used to read the exact order of the DNA in our genes. Think of it as decoding the letters in a very long word, where each letter represents a small part of our genetic code. By reading these letters carefully, scientists can identify tiny differences or errors in the genetic code, known as mutations, which can sometimes lead to diseases or affect how we respond to certain medications. 
                    <br/>
                    Genetics is a key to unlocking many mysteries of our health and traits. By understanding how traits and conditions are passed down, we can better manage our health, make informed decisions, and support those affected by genetic conditions.
