                  As you embark on your genetic testing journey, there are various options available, including targeted testing for a single gene, a selection of genes related to breast cancer risk, or a more extensive panel that screens for a variety of cancer risks.  In this particular stage, your testing will encompass a multigene panel, focusing on genes with a high likelihood of increasing breast cancer susceptibility. The specific genes included in this testing are BRCA1, BRCA2, CDH1, PALB2, PTEN, and TP53.
                    <br/>
                    Potential outcomes of the genetic testing can include positive, negative, uncertain, and incidental findings:
                    <br/>
                    -	Positive – The test has identified a mutation correlated with a heightened risk of hereditary cancer. This knowledge could enable you and your healthcare provider to make informed decisions regarding your medical care, including enhanced screening protocols, risk-lowering surgeries, and preventive pharmacological measures.
                    <br/>
                    -	Negative – No mutations have been detected in the genes analyzed during your test. This signifies that:
                    <ul>
                        <li>As the initial family member is undergoing testing, your baseline risk for cancer parallels that of the average person. However, there remains a possibility of an undetected hereditary cancer risk, which this test may not capture, whether within the tested gene(s) or another gene associated with hereditary cancer.</li>
                        <li>If your results are negative for a familial mutation, your genetic risk may be considered equivalent to the general population.</li>
                    </ul>  
                    -	Uncertain – A genetic variation was found; however, its association with cancer risk is currently unknown. Your cancer risk remains at least on par with the general populace, and there could be an above-average risk due to this genetic variation or another undetected predisposition related to the tested gene(s) or a different gene involved in hereditary cancer.
                    <br/>
                    -	Incidental Findings: Additional findings not specifically related to the assessed cancer risk may emerge during the analysis. These incidental findings could have health implications and require further investigation or medical follow-up.
